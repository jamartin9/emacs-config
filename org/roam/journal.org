**** DONE Investigate router rebooting often.
Model: Netgear Nighthawk AX12 RAX 120v2
Firmware: 1.2.3.28
Reboots sporadically during day/night. More common when using streaming devices such as rokus/fire tvs.
Steps taken:
1. Added surface with airflow and reseat power connection
2. Disabled WMM(wifi multimedia) for 2.4 and 5 ghz under wmm tab on the Qos Setup page, to reduce load (speed is not the issue atm)
3. Went to hidden page ~192.168.1.1/Thermal_FAN.htm~ and verify the Fan temp sensor is  NaNC (broken) (set fan speed level?)
4. Went to hidden page ~192.168.1.1/debug.htm~ and enabled fan always
5. Returned the PoS and got a refund!
