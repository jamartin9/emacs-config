*** Signal
- backdoored locally and [[https://twitter.com/TheChiefNerd/status/1634322345509756930][remotely]]
  - Intel has the SGX keys and AU is a Five Eye Country
- PQXDH for post quantum key exchange
  - uses fairly well known constructs
*** openssl
- Generate a CA
  - CA file "ca.pem" and CA key "privkey.pem" ~openssl req -out ca.pem -new -x509~
- Generate server certificate/key pair (no password required)
  - ~openssl x509 -in your_ca_file.crt -text~ to dump file
  - ~openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024~
  - ~openssl req -key server.key -new -out server.req~
  - ~openssl x509 -req -in server.req -CA CA.pem -CAkey privkey.pem -CAserial file.srl -out server.pem~
    - contents of "file.srl" is a two digit number.  eg. "00"
** notes
- EC
  - safe curves [[https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rigid.html][should be rigid]] and parameters justified
- Quantum
  - SIKE broken in 4th round of NIST
  - Lattice based
    - [[https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/64872195/bernstein-v-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology/][Bernstein in court against NIST]] for potential NSA tampering again (weak keysize?)
    - openssh added hybrid NTRU-Prime (Bernstein on team) for key exchange encryption despite NIST being against 'hybrid' schemes
    - NIST choose CRYSTALS-Kyber([[https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/02/side-channel-attack-against-crystals-kyber.html][side channel power attack]]) for KEM encryption with CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM for signatures. Falcon is alternative signature scheme
      - NTRU may be considered if the *patent* issues with kyber are not resolved
      - Falcon has smallest signature but needs masking for side channel attack (perf affected as it needs constant-time floating point arithmetic)
      - CRYSTALS-Kyber may change nested hashes for security to hold
        - [[https://blog.cr.yp.to/20231003-countcorrectly.html][Kyber is weaker key than advertised]]
  - NIST choose hash based signatures SPHINCS+ as a balance to lattice based signatures
    - highest level of security assurance but large signatures of 8-50 kilobytes
- Dual_EC_DRBG backdoor pushed into NIST standards from NSA
- NSA coerced weak DES keysize of 56 bits
- NSA coerced weak DSA keysize of 512 bits
- NSA operation ORCHESTRA weakens oss projects openssl,python,CA's etc
- Bernstein (EFF) v United States
  - was classed as munitions in 1992 with limited key size for export controls
  - Phil Zimmermann (pgp creator) published code as book (PGP Source Code and Internals) to avoid munitions export in 1994 after criminal investigation for his producing of privacy software
  - ruled software code is protected under 1st amendment as free speech in 1999 (4 years in court)
- FCC illegal encrypted HAM bands
- Nist randomness beacon https://beacon.nist.gov/home
- NIST [[https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05][does not recommend rotating passwords]] regularly
- SMS 2FA is insecure with sim swapping attacks
- ed25519 signatures
  - batch vs single verification
  - oracle pubkey attack
    - https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek/pull/205
  - malleability
    - ed25519-dalek verify_strict
  - blinded keys
