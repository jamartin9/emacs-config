** notes
- [[id:eadf1db2-5c2a-4dbe-b17e-74048162787b][pihole]] for dns cache/forwarder
- SRV records for port numbers
- pozzed by companies
  - pay to play or have domain highjacked by adds once traffic increases
  - piratebay domain wars
  - numerous known malware domains exist for years
  - few implement security 'properly'
    - wildcard cert pinning with BGP route hijack protection (crypto exchange was attacked by this)
  - registrars are generally rent seeking tater heads
    - cloudflare takes law into own handles despite claims of being 'impartial'
      - extortion racket for ddos protection

        - allows 'stressers', malware, doxing for hire services to remain in perpetuity
          - malwarebytes blocked cloudflare ip space because of their unresponsiveness. Cloudflare doubled down despite logs of malware saying it was 'protected speech' to distribute malware
        - personal threats to individuals who criticized them
          - ex. cloudbleed, cloudflare lobbied the FTC to [[https://twitter.com/taviso/status/1566077115992133634][personally investigate the security researchers]] and questioned the legality of openly discussing security research
      - banned 8chan
      - banned kiwifarms (banned by ddos guard the next day)
    - namecheap ceo challenges 'security researchers' to hack their *customers* accounts on twitter for 'clout'
