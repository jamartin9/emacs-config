- Backdoors
  - [[https://research.tue.nl/files/197416841/20220325_Appelbaum_hf.pdf][ubiquity devices]](unifi)
    - any calvium processor
    - amazon hsm
  - intel management engine
  - amd platform security processor
  - firmware level malware (disk controller, usb controller, flashable uefi/bios etc)
  - side channel data transmission such as AM https://github.com/fulldecent/system-bus-radio or differential power analysis
  - printers watermark pages and refuse to print without yellow ink
- Commonly defective (cheap companies and lack of quality control even with standards)
  - HDMI cables (no hdcp, artifacts and non spec bandwidth limits)
  - USBC charging (will not charge certain devices and can even damage ex. Nintendo Switch)
    - lacking resistors usually to inform device of power
  - refurbished drives (smart data wiped)
    - fake drives sold on amazon/walmart/ebay with custom firmware to trick os
  - Used GPUs (cryptocurreny mining wear and cheap factory solder)

- GPS
  - CoCom Limits is the limit placed on GPS devices that disables tracking when it is faster than 1,000 knots and/or an higher than 18,000m.
    - Intended to prevent GPS in intercontinental ballistic missile applications.
    - SDR may not enforce limits (ex. GNSS-SDR)
- SDR
  - krakensdr passive receiver ITAR restricted and censored after IEEE spectrum paper
- Project silica (quartz/glass hard drives)
  - [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-silica/][research project by microsoft]]
  - 10000 year degrade time instead of 10 year like most optical mediums

- iphone14 removed sim card for esim.

- atomic clocks
  - https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/quantum-network-entangled-atomic-clocks
    - optical atmoic clocks entangled on demand
  - helps approximate 'proper' time
  - nuclear atmoic clocks
    - caesium
    - Rubidium
    - GPS in the us uses ~4 per sat (2 caesium and 2 rubidium) to get 'absolute' time and spatial position
    - some NTP nodes use them (NTP is millisecond precision)

- egpus for external gpu
  - OCuLink (optical-copper link) for PCIe connectivity

- RISC-V
  - free ISA
  - 32/64/128(wip) address spaces
  - 32 (16 embeded) int registers
  - 32 floating point registers

- Breadboard
  - simulation https://www.withdiode.com/

- /r/unclebens rice packets to cultivate mushrooms

- BaoFeng programmable in unregistered frequency with CHIRP

- intel optane persistent high write nvme SSD cache
  - [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9387168][ULTRARAM]] quantum RAM paper

- 'auto sear' plastic converts gun to fully automatic

** vehicle
- forscan
  - [[https://forscan.org/support/prepare_trial_el_request.php?lang=en][Require extended license for modification]]. can request multiple.
  - Add user to the ~dialout~ group (debian/fedora) or the ~uucp~ (arch) group then reboot.
  - wine v8.6.0 (used 8.3), forscan v 2.3.53
    - switch should be in the HS position. Forscan will prompt for MS toggle.
    - ~ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com1~
    - under Configuration and Programming
      - EASY MODE (Regular configuration of popular newer models)
        - Run the module APIM
          - edit siriusxm travel link to off
        - BdyCM
          - Fog lights on (bambi mode: high and low beams)
      - MANUAL (AS BUILT) ~not recommended without spreadsheet of values~
        - ~MAKE SURE TO HIT SAVE ALL BEFORE ANY CHANGES~ name the file stock_MODULE.abt
        - Run the Module BdyCM(AS BUILT FORMAT)
          - To disable double honk Edit the entry for: ~726-41-02~ and change the FIRST box to ~0000~ instead of ~0001~. Then click write. LAST DIGIT
        - Run the module IPC(AS BUILT FORMAT)
          - To disable seatbelt chime Edit the entry for IPC ~720-01-01~ Edit the SECOND box to have the THIRD digit be ~0~ (2 for driver only, 4 is passenger, 0 is both). Then click write
- 2021 F150 has 'self driving' BlueCruise
  - raptor does not due to software issues with off road mode
  - [[https://github.com/flowdriveai/flowpilot][generic openpilot]]
  - [[https://github.com/roxasthenobody98/phoenixpilot][open pilot fork for lariat and above]]
    - OBD 2 connector with ForScan can enable Lane assist without the technology package

** board games
- pathfinder system like dnd 3.3
- dnd 5e cap 20
- whitewolf d10 had games in 90's
