- set ~CODEX_HOME~ env var for changing config location
  - ~/prompts~ are markdown stored under the prompts dir of codex home
- ~npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector codex mcp-server~ to inspect codex as an mcp server
  - the mcp reply for resume needs a ~session_id~ given in the first message. the python api messes this up... but can manually be done in the inspector
    - add session_id into out forks prompt md or maybe reading env var ACP_FS_SESSION_ID for the acp agent?
