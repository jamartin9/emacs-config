** notes
- hex is the package manager
- uses erlang OTP libraries (genserver/task/agent etc)
- built on BEAM VM
  - firefly as alternative to beam as a wasi runtime
- popular web framework phoenix with liveview
  - liveview native for apps/desktop apps
- uses message passing instead of shared memory
  - this can cause a problem for data heavy applications with something like liveview as the data is copied from process to process
- dynamic atom creation causes memory leaks (gc does not collect) and can crash if over 1_048_576
- supports hot code reloading using relup and code_change for migration of current state
- libcluster for auto cluster config
  - clustering uses epmd by default
