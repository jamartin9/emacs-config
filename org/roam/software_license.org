* software patents and licenses
** notes
- entirely too many hours wasted arguing about imaginary property
- mostly moot as enforcement is sparse/scarce and trolling is high
- US software patents are not really applicable to the eu (ex. france and x264)
- arbitrary stifling as licenses/patents mean little to china/russia/iran/etc
- DMCA/NTD
  - circumvention of arbitrary controls/locks on things you *OWN* is illegal and punishable by fines and incarceration
    - applied to cars, phones, video games, TVs, streaming services, etc
  - 'Fair Use' is willfully ignored
  - broken with false takedowns and no repercussions for violations of 'good faith belief' of infringement
  - trolled usenet postings mitigations
    - encrypted/scrambled/password protected files
    - remove 1 piece to make invalid but other providers remove different pieces to enable reconstruction
- CLA signage usually gives away right to project
  - allows proprietary forks later that violate original license
** GPL
*** LGPL
- non viral when linking but must allow replacement
*** AGPL
- viral to providing service over network socket
*** GPL
- must provide source code, licenses, copyright notices etc
  - mark modified files with copyright and pointer to license
  - 'should' print license if interactive
- internal use allowed w/o following license
- copyleft viral
  - all linkage must be compatible license
**** GPLv2
- can add exceptions such as classpath, gcc runtime, 'or later'
**** GPLv3
- patent grant
- anti tivoization
  - must allow replacement of software
** Apachev2
- grants patent
- implied CLA (under same license) for project
- must
  - reproduce license

** misc
*** public domain
- no restrictions

*** boost
- close to public domain for countries w/o the legal concept
*** EPL
- v1
  - not GPL compatible
  - ex. clojure
- v2
  - incompatible with EPL v1
  - GPLv2 w/classpath exception for gpl compat
    - effectively makes combined works gplv2+classpath exception
*** MPL
- mozilla license is file based and allows some mixing
